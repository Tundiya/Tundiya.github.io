        I have recently finished the first module of the programming course here on Khan Academy
        and would like to jot down some thoughts about it! First off I would say that it was wildly successful! Most of
        the concrete learning for a first time programmer really seemed to happen in the bonus material of each
        challange.Although, many times I found myself stuck the sheer act of sticking with it and figuring things out,
        either by hitting the documentation or other students comments, really made the most progress for me. Although
        the tutorials and talk throughs are great, I think for the purpose of more effectively commiting these concepts
        to memory the struggle of trying to figure things out and just simply trying things out is
        <strong>huge</strong>. JavaScript itself seems to be rather intuitive, I am sure it is designed that way!
        Getting a good grip on <em>for</em> loops and nested for loops is a huge help. There is an important thing I
        would like to point out that took me a little while to realize. When for loops were first taught in the course
        it did not click in for me that loops don't have to be set against array.length, they can in fact just be set to
        an arbitrary amount. So as to say that if I need a loop to run 40 times, which I ended up doing, you can just
        set i less than 40. DOES NOT NEED TO BE LESS THAN ARRAY.LENGTH. It was a huge moment for me when I finally
        figured out that I can just make a for loop to push as many random numbers into an array as I needed, for
        example in the make it rain project.

        Review of intro to HTML/CSS

        The basic layout of the HTML page is very nicely structured. That is
        the first thing I
        noticed. This structure gives a very intuitive start to using the system. Secondly, the way that CSS feeds into
        it from a simple "style" function and works with a very straight forward heirarchy. Programming in general has
        me very excited because as one thing begins to click it really starts to bring together everything else that has
        been covered. I am looking forward to finishing this module and continueing this post through this weekend! yay
        me! OKAY i just done did er. Finished the module like a good turbonerd should in a few days. The lessons through
        Khan academy are a pretty good intro into using HTML and CSS as far as I can tell. At the end they left with
        with both the resources and knowledge on how to keep on progressing further, which I really appreciated. Along
        the way I found W3schools which seems to be the ultamite CSS cheat sheet! FUCK YES. There remain many things
        that I want to implement on this little blog yet, not to mention make it look better over time. For instance I
        need to know how to make different pages, buttons, JS animations etc. That being said, in the next two or three
        modules with Khan there is promise of this to come! So this blog I hope will continue to be my side project
        while learning through those modules, because implementing that information into a real world application has
        been so very impactful to helping me understand how things really look outside the Khan liveview library wizard.
        For instance, just the process of getting my own code editor set up with a live view, from which I am currently
        writing, linking that editor to a local github, that pulls from a live repository that actually hosts this blog
        onto a live page is kinda fucking huge. Feels real good man. Like I said earlier I really want to keep working
        on this, not only to keep my skillset expanding with HTML/CSS, even though it is really outside my area of
        interest, but also to keep applying things I learn to it from where my interest really lies. In the future I
        really don't want to be doing these posts through a code editor at all, if thats possible. I would prefer to log
        in to my blog, make a fresh post from a nice clean UI that I have somehow built and have it update and post into
        the HTML for me with the layout I have designed.(going to be better than this for reals++).It seems that with
        the more I learn so far the more excited I get for the possible things ahead. I really have to try and pace
        myself at this point, the excitment is getting out of hand and I don't want it to lead to burnout.
